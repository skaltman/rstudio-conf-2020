## Alongside Bill Behrman and Hadley Wickham, I co-teach a class at Stanford called the Data Challenge Lab (DCL). 

---

# The DCL is...


## A skills-based introductory data science class. `r emo::ji("computer")`

--

## For students of all academic backgrounds, sophomores to PhDs. `r emo::ji("woman_student")`

--

## Centered around the tidyverse, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis. 

---
class: center, middle

# What do you mean by skills-based?

---

## We focus on realistic practice designed to build foundational data science skills. 

--

## There is (almost) no lecturing. 

--

## Students spend class time working on assignments and projects, asking questions, and reviewing feedback.

---

# What kinds of projects?

---

### We try to create assignments that simulate real work.

### We often start by recreating work that expert data journalists, social scientists, data scientists, and others have already done.

```


---

## Students explore voter behavior in the 2016 election, global migration patterns, and the opioid epidemic (among many other topics).

# Follow along with dcldata

## dcldata package: https://github.com/dcl-docs/dcldata

### All datasets from our books are collected in dcldata, so students can easily the run code themselves.

```{r}
dcldata::congress %>% 
  head()
```
